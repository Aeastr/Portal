## Why Portal?

Traditional SwiftUI transitions are limited to a single view hierarchy. **Portal** lets you "teleport" elements between views, continuityâ€”perfect for delightful, user-centered UI flows.

- **No hacks:** Clean, idiomatic SwiftUI.
- **Maximum creative freedom:** Design transitions that feel magical, not mechanical.
