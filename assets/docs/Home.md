# Portal

**Portal** is a SwiftUI package for seamless element transitions between viewsâ€”including across sheets and navigation pushes (`NavigationStack`, `.navigationDestination`, etc)â€”using a portal metaphor for maximum flexibility.

- **Effortless transitions:** Move elements smoothly between views, even across navigation boundaries.
- **Flexible:** Works with sheets, navigation stacks, and custom containers.
- **Modern:** Built for SwiftUI, compatible with iOS 15.0 and later.
- **iOS 17 Optimized:** Takes advantage of modern SwiftUI features like Environment values and completion criteria.

## Why Portal?

Traditional SwiftUI transitions are limited to a single view hierarchy. **Portal** lets you "teleport" elements between views, maintaining visual continuityâ€”perfect for delightful, user-centered UI flows.

- **No hacks:** Clean, idiomatic SwiftUI.
- **Maximum creative freedom:** Design transitions that feel magical, not mechanical.
- **Cross-hierarchy support:** Works across sheets, navigation, and any view boundaries.
