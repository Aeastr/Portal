# Contributing to Portal

First off, thank you for your interest in contributing to Portal! üôè Your help makes Portal better for everyone.

## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). I‚Äôm committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and respectful community.

## How to Report Issues

Before opening a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates. When filing a bug report, please include:
- Portal version (e.g. `0.1.2`) and your Swift/Xcode versions  
- Target platform (iOS 15.0+), device or simulator  
- A concise description of the problem and steps to reproduce  
- Minimal code snippet or sample project demonstrating the issue  
- Any relevant console logs or screenshots

## How to Propose Features

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement:
1. Search existing feature requests or discuss in Slack/Discord.  
2. Open a new ‚ÄúFeature Request‚Äù issue with:
   - A clear problem statement  
   - Proposed API or usage sketch  
   - Any design or UX considerations  

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and clone locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aeastr/Portal.git
   cd Portal
   ```
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   ```
3. Make y changes. Follow the [Development Setup](#development-setup) and [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines).

4. Commit with a clear message:
   ```
   feat: add `.portalFade` animation option
   ```

5. Push and open a Pull Request against `main`.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 15.0+ deployment target
- SwiftLint for code style checking:
  ```bash
  brew install swiftlint
  ```

### Initial Setup

1. Clone & open `Portal.xcodeproj` or use the Swift Package in your own project
2. Set up Git hooks for automatic code checking:
   ```bash
   ./Scripts/setup-hooks.sh
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

- Use idiomatic Swift & SwiftUI conventions
- Structure code for readability and reuse
- Keep public APIs minimal and well-documented
- If you introduce new API, add samples under `Sources/Portal/Examples`
- Follow SwiftLint rules (see `.swiftlint.yml`)
- Write unit tests _where applicable_

### Code Style

This project uses SwiftLint to maintain consistent code style. Run checks with:
```bash
# Check all files
swiftlint lint --config .swiftlint.yml

# Auto-fix issues where possible
swiftlint autocorrect --config .swiftlint.yml

# Or use the provided script
./Scripts/run-swiftlint.sh
```

SwiftLint runs automatically:
- **Pre-commit**: Checks staged Swift files
- **CI/CD**: On all pushes and pull requests
- **Xcode**: Can be integrated as a build phase

### Constants & Best Practices

- Use `PortalConstants` for all timing and configuration values
- Don't hardcode delays or durations
- All files must end with a newline
- Example:
  ```swift
  // ‚úÖ Good
  DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + PortalConstants.animationDelay)

  // ‚ùå Bad
  DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1)
  ```

## Running Tests

Portal also includes example targets rather than formal unit tests. To verify functionality:
1. Open the `Portal.xcodeproj` in Xcode  
2. Run each demo (SheetExample, NavigationExample, DifferExample) on a simulator or device  
3. Ensure transitions behave as expected

## Documentation

- **Wiki**: [View Wiki](https://github.com/Aeastr/Portal/wiki), update installation, usage, and examples sections as needed  
- Add or update screenshots/GIFs under `docs/images` with descriptive filenames

## Pull Request Process

1. Link your PR to the relevant issue (if there is one)  
2. Describe what you‚Äôve changed and why  
3. Keep PRs focused‚Äîone feature or fix per PR  
4. Ensure all examples build and run without warnings or errors  
5. Be responsive to review feedback

## Continuous Integration

All PRs are validated by CI:
- Build on latest Xcode  
- Run example targets  
- Lint documentation links

Please address any CI failures before merging.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### SwiftLint Issues

- **SwiftLint not found**: Install with `brew install swiftlint`
- **Hooks not running**: Run `./Scripts/setup-hooks.sh` to configure Git hooks
- **CI failing**: Run `./Scripts/run-swiftlint.sh` locally first to catch issues
- **Auto-fix not working**: Run `swiftlint --fix --config .swiftlint.yml` manually
- **Too many violations**: Focus on errors first (red), warnings (yellow) can be addressed later

### Build Issues

- **Swift version mismatch**: Ensure you're using Xcode 15+ with Swift 5.9+
- **Package resolution failed**: Try `swift package resolve` or clean build folder
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `swift package update`

### Git Hook Issues

- **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x .githooks/*` and `chmod +x Scripts/*.sh`
- **Hooks not executing**: Check that `git config core.hooksPath` points to `.githooks`
- **Commit blocked by linting**: Use `git commit --no-verify` to bypass (use sparingly!)

### Testing Issues

- **Examples not building**: Ensure `#if DEBUG` wrapper is present
- **Portal transitions not working**: Check that `PortalContainer` wraps your root view
- **Memory leaks**: Weak references are intentional for portal cleanup
