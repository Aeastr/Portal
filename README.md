## Features

- **Seamless Transitions**  
  Effortlessly animate floating overlays between source and destination views using simple view modifiers.

- **PortalFlowingHeader**  
  Smooth, scroll-based header transitions where content flows from the scroll view into the navigation bar. Perfect for polished, native-feeling iOS experiences. (iOS 18.0+)

- **Works with Standard Presentations**  
  Fully compatible with SwiftUI's built-in presentation methods like `.sheet` and `.navigationDestination`.

- **Flexible Anchoring**  
  Mark any view as a portal source or destination, keyed by static IDs or `Identifiable` items.

- **Easy Integration**  
  Add portal support to any view hierarchy with a single modifier or wrapper, no custom presentation code required.

- **Customizable Animations**  
  Fine-tune transitions with `PortalTransitionConfig` for control over timing, easing, and corner styling.

- **Modern SwiftUI Support**  
  Optimized for iOS 17+ with backward compatibility for iOS 15 and 16.
