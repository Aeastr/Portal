import SwiftUI

/// Corner radius configuration for portal transition elements.
///
/// This struct defines the corner styling for both the source and destination
/// elements of a portal transition. It allows for smooth interpolation between
/// different corner radius values during the animation, creating visually
/// cohesive transitions even when source and destination have different styling.
///
/// **Corner Interpolation:**
/// During the transition, the corner radius is smoothly interpolated from the
/// source value to the destination value, ensuring visual continuity throughout
/// the animation.
///
/// **Style Consistency:**
/// The corner style (circular vs. continuous) is applied uniformly to maintain
/// visual consistency with the rest of the application's design language.

    /// This value defines the corner radius of the element at the beginning
    /// of the portal transition. The animation will start with this radius
    /// and interpolate toward the destination radius.
    ///
    /// A value of 0 creates sharp corners (rectangular appearance).

    ///
    /// Defines the mathematical curve used for creating rounded corners.
    /// This affects the visual appearance of the corners during the entire
    /// transition animation.

    /// - `.circular`: Traditional circular arc corners (iOS default)
    /// - `.continuous`: Apple's continuous corner curve (more organic appearance)
