# Portal

**Portal** is a SwiftUI package for seamless element transitions between viewsâ€”including across sheets and navigation pushes (`NavigationStack`, `.navigationDestination`, etc)â€”using a portal metaphor for maximum flexibility.

- **Effortless transitions:** Move elements smoothly between views, even across navigation boundaries.
- **Flexible:** Works with sheets, navigation stacks, and custom containers.
- **Modern:** Built for SwiftUI, compatible with iOS 15.0 and later.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **`PortalContainer { ... }`** - Manages the overlay window logic required for floating portal animations across hierarchies. Install it once at your root view to cover all presentations.
- **`.portal(id:, .source/.destination)`** - Mark views as source or destination anchors using string IDs.
- **`.portal(item:, .source/.destination)`** - Mark views using `Identifiable` items.
- **`.PortalTransitions(id: isActive: ...)` & `.PortalTransitions(item: ...)`** - Drive transitions with boolean bindings or optional `Identifiable` items.
- **Flexible Animation Control** - Use any SwiftUI `Animation` with optional corner radius morphing and completion criteria.
- **iOS 15+ Compatible** - Maintains backward compatibility with fallback implementations.

## Why Portal?

Traditional SwiftUI transitions are limited to a single view hierarchy. **Portal** enables element transitions between views across different hierarchies, maintaining visual continuity.

- **Clean SwiftUI integration:** Uses standard SwiftUI patterns and conventions.
- **Cross-hierarchy support:** Works across sheets, navigation, and any view boundaries.
- **Flexible API:** Supports both static IDs and dynamic `Identifiable` items.
