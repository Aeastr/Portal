## Documentation

For full installation steps, usage guides, and examples, visit the [Portal Wiki](https://github.com/Aeastr/Portal/wiki):

> Targeting iOS 15/16? Pin your dependency to `v2.1.0` or the `legacy/ios15` branch.

### Package Targets

- **`Portal`** ‚Äì Core transition system using standard SwiftUI APIs. Separate view instances allow different sizes at source/destination. **‚úÖ App Store safe.**

- **`PortalPrivate`** ‚Äì Portal transitions powered by view mirroring. Single shared instance with perfect state preservation but same-size constraint. **‚ö†Ô∏è Private API (obfuscated).**

- **`PortalView`** ‚Äì Low-level `_UIPortalView` wrapper for direct UIKit integration. **‚ö†Ô∏è Private API (obfuscated).**

**For most users:** Just `import Portal`. The other targets are experimental and intended for advanced scenarios requiring view instance sharing.

## Features

- **Seamless Transitions**  
  Effortlessly animate floating overlays between source and destination views using simple view modifiers.

- **Works with Standard Presentations**  
  Fully compatible with SwiftUI‚Äôs built-in presentation methods like `.sheet` and `.navigationDestination`.

- **Flexible Anchoring**  
  Mark any view as a portal source or destination, keyed by static IDs or `Identifiable` items.

- **Easy Integration**  
  Install `PortalContainer` once at your root view and every sheet/navigation stack automatically gains portal support‚Äîno custom presentation code required.

- **Customizable Animations**  
  Fine-tune transitions with `PortalTransitionConfig` and drive bespoke transition layers via the `AnimatedPortalLayer` protocol.

- **Modern SwiftUI Support**  
  Built for iOS 17+ with the latest SwiftUI APIs and animation completion criteria

- **Debug Overlays**
  Visual indicators in DEBUG builds showing portal sources, destinations, and animation states. Zero overhead in Release builds.

- **Structured Logging**
  Built-in diagnostics via [LogOutLoud](https://github.com/Aeastr/LogOutLoud) integration. See the [Debugging Guide](https://github.com/Aeastr/Portal/wiki/Debugging) for details.
